# Housing-Assignment
MSDS 431 Command-Line Assignment

This repository has a Go command-line application that will try to perform similar operations as R-Studio and Python. This application, main.go, reads the Housing CSV file, and iterates through each column to compute summary statistics for each variable. The summary statistics are as follows: mean, min, max, stdev.


All results from the three .txt files show the same values, which means the code ran correctly. 

According to the processing times for each, Python was faster than Go at running all of these statistics and making an output .txt file.
